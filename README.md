# DLROMs: a Python package for Deep Learning based Reduced Order Models

**DLROMs** is a deep learning library for model order reduction that leverages on packages such as Pytorch and FEniCS. It comes with a basic version (no FEniCS required) and an advanced one. The techniques made available within this library are reminiscent of the following scientific articles:

This library was written, and is currently maintained, by **Nicola Rares Franco**, **Ph.D.**, MOX, Politecnico di Milano. For a tensorflow alternative, we recommend the repositories by Stefania Fresca, Ph.D. (link: https://github.com/stefaniafresca).
